# TKA Deployment Guide

This guide covers deployment options for the TKA monorepo structure.

## Web Application Deployment (Netlify)

### Monorepo Deployment (Recommended)

The TKA project is structured as a monorepo with separate `desktop/` and `web/` directories. For Netlify deployment, you can deploy directly from the monorepo without creating separate repositories.

#### Setup Instructions:

1. **Connect Repository to Netlify:**
   - Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your GitHub account and select the `TKA` repository
   - Netlify will automatically detect the `netlify.toml` configuration

2. **Build Configuration:**
   The root-level `netlify.toml` is configured to:
   - Set `web/` as the base directory
   - Run `npm ci && npm run build` in the web directory
   - Publish the `build/` output directory
   - Use Node.js 18

3. **Domain Configuration:**
   - Configure your custom domain in Netlify settings
   - HTTPS is automatically enabled
   - Branch deploys are available for preview

#### Manual Deployment (Alternative):

If you prefer to deploy manually:

```bash
# From the web/ directory
cd web/
npm ci
npm run build

# Deploy using Netlify CLI
npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

### Environment Variables

Set these in Netlify's environment variables section if needed:
- `NODE_VERSION=18`
- Any API keys or configuration specific to your deployment

## Desktop Application

The desktop application is a Python-based application that doesn't require web deployment. Distribution options include:

### PyInstaller (Recommended for Distribution)

Create standalone executables:

```bash
# From the desktop/ directory
cd desktop/
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py  # Adjust main.py to your entry point
```

### Development Setup

For development and testing:

```bash
cd desktop/
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have one
python main.py  # Adjust to your entry point
```

## Monorepo Benefits

Keeping both projects in the same repository provides:

1. **Shared Resources:** Common data files, documentation, and assets
2. **Synchronized Releases:** Version both applications together
3. **Simplified CI/CD:** Single repository to manage
4. **Code Sharing:** Potential for shared utilities or types

## CI/CD Considerations

You can set up GitHub Actions to:
- Test both applications
- Deploy web app to Netlify automatically
- Build desktop app releases
- Run cross-platform tests

Example workflow locations:
- `.github/workflows/web-deploy.yml` - Web deployment
- `.github/workflows/desktop-build.yml` - Desktop builds
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` - Run tests for both projects
