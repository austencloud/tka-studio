# Documentation Archive

This folder contains documentation that was moved out of the main docs folder to reduce noise and improve focus on current, actionable documentation.

## Completed Implementations

The `completed-implementations/` folder contains documentation for features and migrations that have been completed:

- **graph-editor-migration-plan.md** - Migration plan for the graph editor (completed)
- **modern-graph-editor-implementation-roadmap.md** - Implementation roadmap (completed)
- **legacy-graph-editor-analysis.md** - Analysis of legacy graph editor (migration completed)
- **graph_editor_error_handling_implementation.md** - Error handling implementation details (completed)
- **sequence_restoration_data_flow.md** - Sequence restoration implementation (completed)
- **option-picker-sizing-solution.md** - Option picker sizing solution (implemented)

## Archival Strategy

These documents were archived because:
1. They represent completed work that doesn't need ongoing reference
2. The knowledge they contain should now be embedded in code comments or current architecture docs
3. They were creating noise in the main docs folder for new developers

## Retention Policy

Consider deleting this archive folder after 6 months if it remains unused. The git history will preserve these documents if needed for historical reference.
