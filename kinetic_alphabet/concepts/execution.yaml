# Execution Techniques - Physical methods for performing TKA sequences

metadata:
  description: "Body mechanics and spatial techniques for executing sequences"
  importance: "Essential for performing complex sequences without finger-spinning"
  prerequisite: "Familiarity required for words section performance"

# Core Execution Methods
execution_methods:
  negative_space:
    description: "Pass prop through space around body (above shoulders, behind elbows, etc.)"
    benefits:
      - "Face audience consistently"
      - "Reduce body movement" 
      - "Maintain visual presentation"
    applications:
      shoulder_space: "Pass thumb end through space above right shoulder"
      arm_space: "Pass pinky end on inside of right arm"
    examples:
      four_petal_antispin: "Pass thumb end through negative space above right shoulder on beat 2"
      
  body_turns:
    description: "Turn torso to execute patterns with longer staves"
    benefits:
      - "Add movement and energy"
      - "Handle longer staff lengths"
      - "Create contrast in sequences"
    applications:
      wheel_plane_access: "Turn to access plane behind performer"
      execution_and_aesthetics: "Serves both technical execution and artistic expression"
    examples:
      360_isolation: "Turn torso left on beat 3, staff moves in wheel-plane relative to left-facing view"
      
  combination_approach:
    description: "Use both negative space and body turns"
    flexibility: "Each method equally important for maximum capability"
    sequence_variation: "Same sequence can use different execution methods"

# Finger Spinning Avoidance
finger_spinning:
  problems:
    - "Loss of precision"
    - "Inability to check thumb orientation on each beat"
    - "Reduces tracking capability"
    - "Not encouraged by TKA system"
    
  alternatives:
    primary: "Negative space and body turns"
    thumb_tracking: "Mark thumb end with line for position checking"
    encouragement: "System design encourages proper technique"

# Thumb Orientation Tracking
thumb_tracking:
  purpose: "Keep track of rotations and check position on every beat"
  notation: "Mark thumb end with line in pictographs"
  center_point_rule: "An end is always at center point in examples"
  
  orientation_types:
    thumbs_in: "Both thumbs pointing toward center"
    thumbs_out: "Both thumbs pointing away from center"
    mixed: "One thumb in, one thumb out (in/out or out/in)"
    
  starting_convention:
    default: "Most sequences start with thumbs in for consistency"
    flexibility: "Equally valid to start from any thumb orientation"
    sequence_variation: "Same word feels different from different orientations"

# Staff Motion Execution
staff_motions:
  prospin:
    description: "Prop rotates same direction as handpath"
    base_unit: "90 degree isolation"
    thumb_effect: "Orientation remains same throughout motion"
    execution: "Natural following motion"
    
  antispin:
    description: "Prop rotates opposite direction of handpath"
    base_unit: "90 degree antispin"
    thumb_effect: "Ends swap orientation (in→out, out→in)"
    execution: "Counter-rotation against handpath"
    
  dash_motion:
    thumb_effect: "Ends also swap orientation in base dash"
    center_point: "Halfway through motion, staff center is at grid center"

# Plane Transitions
plane_usage:
  wall_plane:
    description: "Primary performance plane facing audience"
    default: "Standard orientation for most sequences"
    
  wheel_plane:
    description: "Perpendicular plane accessed through body turns"
    access_method: "Turn body left/right to access"
    temporary_usage: "Brief transitions for specific beats"
    
  plane_switching:
    example: "Beat 5 right hand on left side requires body turn to wheel plane"
    return: "Turn back to center for following beats"
    integration: "Seamless transitions between planes"

# Sequence Execution Variations
execution_variations:
  thumb_orientation_impact:
    same_word_different_feel: "AABB feels different with different thumb starts"
    negative_space_types: "Above/below shoulder vs behind elbow"
    technique_requirements: "Different orientations require different execution approaches"
    
  body_turn_timing:
    beat_specific: "Turn on specific beats for technical reasons"
    energy_addition: "Also serves aesthetic/contrast purposes"
    plane_coordination: "Coordinate staff positions with body orientation"
    
  execution_choice:
    flexibility: "Same sequence can be executed multiple ways"
    performer_preference: "Choose based on comfort and aesthetic goals"
    technical_requirements: "Some sequences may require specific approaches"

# Learning Progression
learning_approach:
  fundamental_concepts:
    prerequisites: ["360° Isolation", "4-Petal Antispin"]
    vtg_reference: "VTG 1:1 motion familiarity helpful"
    
  practice_recommendations:
    direction_practice: "Practice each word in both directions"
    orientation_practice: "Try with thumbs out after mastering thumbs in"
    execution_experimentation: "Try both negative space and body turns"
    
  skill_development:
    precision_maintenance: "Check thumb orientation on every beat"
    technique_integration: "Combine execution methods fluidly"
    sequence_mastery: "Build from simple to complex patterns"
