metadata:
  description: "Hand and prop reversal techniques that open up huge possibilities"
  types: ["hand_reversal", "prop_reversal", "full_reversal"]
  impact: "Create variations and enable complex sequences"

# Core Reversal Types
reversal_types:
  hand_reversal:
    description: "Hand returns to point it came from previously"
    prop_behavior: "Prop continues direction without changing"
    rotation_effect: "Changes prospin to antispin and vice-versa (relative to center point)"
    disruption_level: "Least disruptive reversal"
    usage_note: "Already used in previous examples"
    transitions:
      prospin_to_antispin: "Pro→Anti"
      antispin_to_prospin: "Anti→Pro"
    
  prop_reversal:
    description: "Hand continues to next point while prop reverses direction"
    prop_behavior: "Prop changes rotation direction"
    rotation_effect: "Changes prospin to antispin and vice-versa"
    notation: "R/R added in corresponding color between pictographs"
    intuition_level: "Less intuitive than hand reversal"
    transitions:
      prospin_to_antispin: "Pro→Anti"
      antispin_to_prospin: "Anti→Pro"
    
  full_reversal:
    description: "Both prop and hand retrace their paths"
    behavior: "Return to previous position as if going backwards in time"
    notation: "R/R indicates prop reversal component"
    attention_marker: "Draws attention that something unusual is happening"
    transitions:
      prospin_to_prospin: "Pro→Pro"
      antispin_to_antispin: "Anti→Anti"

# Reversal Applications
reversal_applications:
  hybrid_combinations:
    acac_sequence:
      requirement: "Prop-reversals necessary when combining hybrid C with non-hybrid A"
      impossibility: "Cannot execute ACAC without prop-reversals"
      
    bcbc_sequence:
      pattern: "Right hand prop-reversing after every beat"
      outcome: "Eventually returns to home"
      
  reversal_placement_effects:
    description: "Reversal location in word leads to notably different outcomes"
    variability: "Same word (e.g., AABB) has multiple presentations"
    includes: "Variations on reversals and thumb orientation"
    
  reversal_alternation:
    pattern: "Reversals can alternate between hands"
    example: "Left (R) and right (R) alternating pattern"
    complexity: "Can use every reversal type in single sequence"

# Notation System
notation_rules:
  prop_reversal_marking:
    symbol: "R/R"
    color: "Corresponding hand color (red/blue)"
    placement: "Between pictographs where reversal occurs"
    purpose: "Indicate something unusual happening"
    
  no_marking_needed:
    hand_reversal: "No special notation required"
    reason: "Least disruptive and most common"
    
  reversal_identification:
    challenge: "In complex sequences, identify where each reversal type occurs"
    skill_development: "Practice recognizing reversal patterns"

# Reversal in CAP Sequences
cap_integration:
  mirrored_caps:
    reversal_timing: "Often use reversals to achieve mirroring"
    example: "Reversal after beat 1, repeat mirrored with reversal after beat 5"
    
  continuous_paths:
    versus_broken_paths: "Reversals can create either continuous or broken hand paths"
    design_choice: "Full-reversals create broken paths, hand-reversals maintain continuity"

# Advanced Reversal Concepts
advanced_applications:
  body_turn_integration:
    example: "Beat 5 with right hand coming down on left side requires body turn"
    plane_switching: "Move from wall plane to wheel plane via body turn"
    execution_method: "Body turn serves both motion execution and energy/contrast"
    
  reversal_combinations:
    all_three_types: "Hand, prop, and full reversals in single sequence"
    identification_challenge: "Advanced skill to recognize each type"
    
  static_beat_reversals:
    description: "Reversal with beat of no motion in between"
    notation: "Still mark with R for prop reversal indication"
    example: "BΔMX sequence with right hand stops on beats 2 and 4"

# Reversal Effects on Sequence Character
sequence_impact:
  thumb_orientation_changes:
    antispin_effect: "Ends swap orientation (in→out, out→in)"
    dash_effect: "Thumb ends also swap orientation in base dash"
    prospin_effect: "Thumb orientation remains same"
    
  execution_requirements:
    negative_space: "Required for certain reversal sequences"
    body_turns: "Alternative to negative space for execution"
    finger_spinning_avoidance: "Maintain precision with proper technique"
    
  sequence_feel:
    different_outcomes: "Same letter sequence feels completely different"
    factors: "Start position, rotation direction, thumb orientation"
    pictograph_necessity: "Full sequence pictographs needed for complete clarity"
