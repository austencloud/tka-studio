# CAPs - Continuous Assembly Patterns

metadata:
  description: "Sequences where words repeat to trace complimentary patterns"
  requirement: "Word must end on variation of its start position"
  outcome: "Eventually returns to start position (home)"

# Core CAP Types
cap_types:
  mirrored:
    description: "Second repetition's pictographs reflect the first"
    effect: "Changes rotation direction"
    reflection_plane: "Usually horizontal plane"
    example_note: "Each column reflected across horizontal axis"
    
  rotated:
    description: "Each repetition ends in rotated variation of previous position"
    typical_rotation: "90 degrees"
    repetitions_to_home: "Usually 4 repetitions (for 90° rotation)"
    example_note: "90° rotation finally returning to start position"
    
  swapped:
    description: "Each repetition swaps roles of right/left hands"
    visual_effect: "Props shapes look the same"
    body_effect: "Changes body motion significantly"
    color_coding: "Red/blue hand assignments switch"

# Complex CAP Types (combinations)
complex_caps:
  mirrored_and_swapped:
    description: "Combines mirroring with hand role swapping"
    complexity: "Changes both rotation direction and hand assignments"
    
  rotated_and_swapped:
    description: "Combines rotation with hand role swapping"
    examples: ["16-count sequences with quadrant filling"]
    
  rotated_mirrored_swapped:
    description: "Triple combination of all three CAP types"
    complexity: "Highest complexity CAP pattern"

# CAP Length Categories
cap_lengths:
  eight_count:
    description: "4-letter word repeated twice"
    examples: ["DJII", "BBLF", "KIEC"]
    
  sixteen_count:
    description: "4-letter word repeated 4 times, or 8-letter word repeated twice"
    examples: ["GθOZ", "EΔQY", "CΣNZIθVW", "IIΩXKEΣY"]
    
# Position-Specific CAP Patterns
position_caps:
  type_1_caps:
    alpha_beta_focus: "Letters moving between/within Alpha and Beta"
    examples: ["DJII", "BBLF", "KIEC"]
    
  gamma_caps:
    gamma_focus: "Γ→Γ letters connecting to other Γ→Γ letters"
    examples: ["SOTR", "VPUQ", "MVNU"]
    rotated_pattern: "Pictographs rotated 180° in second repetition"
    
  type_2_caps:
    travel_focus: "Using Type 2 letters to travel between α/β and Γ"
    examples: ["BΣTX", "EΔUZ", "OYHθ"]
    rotation_pattern: "Each repetition rotated 180°"

# Reversal CAPs
reversal_caps:
  prop_reversal_caps:
    description: "CAPs incorporating prop reversals"
    examples: ["EΣQY", "TWKθ", "BΔMX"]
    pattern: "Usually Rotated CAPs"
    notation: "R/R marks prop reversals"
    
  full_reversal_caps:
    description: "CAPs incorporating full reversals"
    examples: ["CCKE", "FLII", "DAK"]
    complexity: "Also include prop reversals within words"
    challenge: "Identify each reversal type"

# CAP Construction Principles
construction:
  word_ending_requirement:
    rule: "Word must end on variation of start position"
    enables: "Seamless repetition to trace complimentary pattern"
    
  home_return:
    definition: "Return to exact starting position and orientation"
    achievement: "Through calculated repetitions with transformations"
    
  pattern_completion:
    goal: "Trace geometric or symmetric patterns in space"
    aesthetic: "Creates visually and kinesthetically satisfying sequences"

# CAP Applications
applications:
  solo_practice:
    benefit: "Extended sequences with built-in structure"
    
  group_choreography:
    variations: ["tunnel", "side by side", "staggered", "mirrored/rotated variations"]
    creative_potential: "Dynamic and engaging when applied by multiple performers"
    
  musical_integration:
    timing: "CAP lengths often align with musical phrasing"
    repetition: "Matches musical repetition and development"
