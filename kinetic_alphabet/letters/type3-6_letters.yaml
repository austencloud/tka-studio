  description: "Letters for motion types 3-6"
  note: "Types 3 and 5 reuse letters from other types with modifications"

# Type 3 - Cross-Shift
type_3_cross_shift:
  description: "Uses Type 2 letters followed by dash (-) to indicate other hand dashing"
  notation_rule: "Dash symbol in glyph equals dash arrow on graph"

  examples:
    gamma_to_alpha:
      - "W-" # W Dash
      - "X-" # X Dash
    gamma_to_beta:
      - "Y-" # Y Dash  
      - "Z-" # Z Dash
    alpha_to_gamma:
      - "Σ-" # Sigma Dash

# Type 5 - Dual-Dash
type_5_dual_dash:
  description: "Both hands dash simultaneously to opposite points"
  notation_rule: "Uses Type 4 letters with dash suffix (-)"
  end_position_rule: "End position remains the same"

dash_notation_consistency:
  rule: "Dash symbol (-) always indicates additional dashing motion"
  application:
    - "Type 3: Other hand dashes while one shifts"
    - "Type 5: Both hands dash (versus Type 4 single dash)"
