# Type 2 Letters - Shift motions (traveling between Alpha/Beta and Gamma)

metadata:
  description: "Type 2 Shift motions - one hand shifts, other remains static"
  purpose: "Travel between Alpha/Beta positions and Gamma position"
  categories: ["opening", "closing"]
  note: "Simple at this stage, becomes complex when adding rotations to static motions"
