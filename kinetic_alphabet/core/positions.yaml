  description: "Alpha, Beta, and Gamma - the core hand positions in TKA"

positions:
  alpha:
    symbol: "α"
    name: "Alpha"
    description: "Hands occupy points across from each other"
    characteristics:
      - "Opposite positioning"
      - "Can be rotated or mirrored"
      - "Maintains symmetry across center point"
    variations:
      orientations: ["vertical", "horizontal", "diagonal"]
      thumb_positions: ["thumbs_in", "thumbs_out", "mixed"]
    
    timing_modes:
      split_same: "Both hands move in same direction but from opposite positions"
      split_opp: "Hands move in opposite directions from opposite positions"
      tog_opp: "Hands move in opposite directions (for Alpha<->Beta transitions)"
    
  beta:
    symbol: "β"
    name: "Beta" 
    description: "Hands occupy the same point"
    characteristics:
      - "Overlapping hand positions"
      - "Both staves at same grid location"
      - "Can be at any of the 4 hand points"
    variations:
      locations: ["top", "bottom", "left", "right"]
      thumb_positions: ["thumbs_in", "thumbs_out", "mixed"]
    
    timing_modes:
      tog_same: "Both hands move in same direction from same general area"
      tog_opp: "Hands move in opposite directions (for Beta<->Alpha transitions)"
      
  gamma:
    symbol: "Γ"
    name: "Gamma"
    description: "Hands form a right angle"
    characteristics:
      - "90-degree relationship between hands"
      - "Quarter-time based movements"
      - "Two distinct mode types"
    
    modes:
      quarter_opp:
        description: "Quarter-Opposite timing mode"
        variations:
          parallel: "Hands move in parallel directions"
          antiparallel: "Hands move in opposite directions"
          
      quarter_same:
        description: "Quarter-Same timing mode"
        note: "Does not have parallel/antiparallel variations like Quarter-Opp"
        characteristics:
          - "More constrained movement patterns"
          - "Different flow from Quarter-Opp"

# Staff orientation tracking
staff_orientation:
  thumb_end_marking:
    purpose: "Track rotations and position on every beat"
    benefits:
      - "Encourages negative space/body turns"
      - "Prevents finger spinning"
      - "Maintains positional awareness"
    note: "An end is always at the center point in examples"
    
  starting_convention:
    default: "thumbs_in"
    note: "Most sequences start with thumbs in for consistency"
    flexibility: "Equally valid to start from any thumb orientation"
