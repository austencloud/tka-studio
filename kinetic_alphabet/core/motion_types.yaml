# Motion Types - The six fundamental movement categories in TKA

metadata:
  description: "Six types of hand motions that form the backbone of TKA notation"
  note: "Each type combines fundamental motions (shift, dash, static) in different ways"

# Three fundamental motions
fundamental_motions:
  shift:
    description: "Move to an adjacent point"
    distance: "short"
    
  dash:
    description: "Move to the opposite point"  
    distance: "long"
    note: "Moves slightly faster due to longer travel distance"
    
  static:
    description: "Stay at current point"
    distance: "none"

# Six derived motion types
motion_types:
  type_1:
    name: "Dual-Shift"
    description: "Both hands travel to adjacent points"
    fundamental_combination: "shift + shift"
    timing_modes:
      split_same: "Both hands move same direction from opposite positions (offset timing)"
      tog_same: "Both hands move same direction from same area (synchronized timing)"
      split_opp: "Hands move opposite directions from opposite positions (offset timing)"
      tog_opp: "Hands move opposite directions, hit convergence simultaneously"
    timing_explanation:
      tog: "Together time - hands hit key points simultaneously"
      split: "Split time - hands hit key points with offset timing"
      determination: "Tog vs Split determined by continuing handpath to see if convergence is simultaneous"
    focus: "Simultaneous motions between two positions, relative to center point"
    
  type_2:
    name: "Shift"
    description: "One hand travels to adjacent point, other remains static"
    fundamental_combination: "shift + static"
    categories:
      opening: "Moving from Gamma to Alpha/Beta"
      closing: "Moving from Alpha/Beta to Gamma"
    note: "Simple at this stage, becomes complex with rotations added to static motions"
    
  type_3:
    name: "Cross-Shift"
    description: "One hand shifts, other dashes"
    fundamental_combination: "shift + dash"
    timing_note: "Dash moves slightly faster, requires halfway point timing"
    creates: "Zan's Diamond variations"
    
  type_4:
    name: "Dash"
    description: "One hand travels to opposite point, other remains static"
    fundamental_combination: "dash + static"
    examples:
      alpha_to_beta: "Creates two-beta sequence"
      gamma_to_gamma: "Creates 4-beat sequence"
    
  type_5:
    name: "Dual-Dash"
    description: "Both hands travel to opposite points"
    fundamental_combination: "dash + dash"
    effect: "Both hands dash simultaneously to opposite points"
    
  type_6:
    name: "Static"
    description: "Both hands remain still for a beat"
    fundamental_combination: "static + static"
    complexity_note: "Becomes interesting when adding prop rotations"

# Timing and coordination
timing_concepts:
  halfway_point:
    description: "Midpoint in Cross-Shift motions"
    purpose: "Ensures dash moves at correct speed relative to shift"
    note: "One hand at center point, one at diagonal hand point"
    
  simultaneous_focus:
    description: "TKA emphasizes motions between two positions relative to center"
    application: "Particularly important in Dual-Shift movements"
