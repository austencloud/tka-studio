# CAPs (Continuous Assembly Patterns)
caps:
  types:
    mirrored:
      description: "Second repetition reflects the first"
      changes: "rotation direction"
      
    rotated:
      description: "Each repetition ends in rotated variation"
      typical_rotation: "90 degrees"
      
    swapped:
      description: "Each repetition swaps roles of right/left hands"
      effect: "Changes body motion significantly"

# Reversals
reversals:
  hand_reversal:
    description: "Hand returns to previous point, prop continues direction"
    effect: "Changes prospin to antispin and vice-versa"
    disruption: "Least disruptive"
    
  prop_reversal:
    description: "Hand continues to next point, prop reverses direction"
    notation: "R/R in corresponding color"
    effect: "Changes prospin to antispin and vice-versa"
    
  full_reversal:
    description: "Both prop and hand retrace paths"
    notation: "R/R indicates prop reversal component"
    effect: "Return to previous position like going backwards in time"

# Execution Notes
execution:
  negative_space:
    description: "Pass prop through space around body"
    benefit: "Face audience, reduce body movement"
    
  body_turns:
    description: "Turn torso to execute patterns"
    benefit: "Add movement, handle longer staves"
    
  thumb_orientation:
    importance: "Track rotations and check position on every beat"
    variations: ["thumbs in", "thumbs out", "mixed"]
    
  finger_spinning:
    recommendation: "Avoid - use negative space and body turns instead"
    reason: "Maintains precision and tracking ability"
