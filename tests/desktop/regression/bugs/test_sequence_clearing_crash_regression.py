TEST LIFECYCLE: REGRESSION
PURPOSE: Prevent sequence clearing crash from reoccurring
BUG_REPORT: Critical bugs found during Sprint 2 - sequence operations causing crashes
FIXED_DATE: 2025-06-14
AUTHOR: @austencloud

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI AGENTS:
This is a REGRESSION test that prevents a specific bug from reoccurring.
Only suggest deletion if the entire sequence feature is removed from the system.
Focus on reproducing the exact scenario that caused the original bug.
