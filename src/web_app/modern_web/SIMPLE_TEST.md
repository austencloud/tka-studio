# Simple Pictograph Test

Super simple test to see if a single pictograph renders correctly.

## How to use:

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the test page:**
   Go to: `http://localhost:5174/simple-test`

3. **What you should see:**
   - A pictograph with the letter 'A'
   - Blue arrow at the top (north) going clockwise
   - Red arrow at the bottom (south) going counter-clockwise
   - Diamond grid background

That's it. If you see the pictograph with those elements, it's working.
