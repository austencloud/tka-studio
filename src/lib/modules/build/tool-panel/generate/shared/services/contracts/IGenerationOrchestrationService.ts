 * - Routes between freeform and circular generation modes
 * - Composes multiple focused generation services
 * - Handles the complete sequence building pipeline
 * - Returns fully constructed SequenceData ready for display
 *
 * Does NOT:
 * - Manage UI state (that's the state file's job)
 * - Handle animations (that's the caller's responsibility)
 * - Update the workbench directly (returns data instead)
