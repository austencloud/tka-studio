# Level 5: Centric Variations - Center Position Integration

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Adds center position as valid hand location with dual orientation paradigms**

Level 5 introduces the center position as a valid location for hands, fundamentally changing the orientation system. When props are at center, orientations become absolute compass directions instead of relative to center, creating a dual paradigm system.

## 📐 Mathematical Foundation

### **Center Position Integration**

- **9th position**: Center position added as valid hand location
- **Position expansion**: From 8 to 9 total positions (9 × 9 = 81 position combinations)
- **Dual paradigm system**: Relative orientations (perimeter) + absolute orientations (center)
- **Paradigm switching**: Orientation system depends on hand location

### **Dual Orientation Paradigms**

- **Perimeter positions**: Use relative orientations (IN, OUT, CLOCK, COUNTER)
- **Center position**: Use absolute orientations (compass directions)
- **Paradigm determination**: Hand location determines which orientation system applies
- **Orientation calculation**: Different mathematics for center vs perimeter

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### **New Motion Type: Half-Dash (#)**

- **Symbol**: Hash symbol (#) indicates half-dash motion
- **Mechanics**: Portmanteau of "half" and "dash"
- **Purpose**: Enables movement to/from center position
- **Lookup table**: Requires custom orientation calculation logic

### **Center Position Mechanics**

- **Placement methods**:
  - User places hand at center at sequence start
  - Half-dash motion brings hand to center
- **Orientation determination**: Based on motion flow and rotation amount
- **Absolute orientations**: Compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) when at center

### **Orientation Paradigm Rules**

- **At perimeter**: Use relative orientations (IN/OUT/CLOCK/COUNTER relative to center)
- **At center**: Use absolute orientations (compass directions)
- **Motion crossing**: Information needed about paradigm switching during motion
- **Calculation logic**: Different orientation mathematics for each paradigm

### **Position Mathematics**

- **9 total positions**: 8 perimeter + 1 center
- **81 position combinations**: 9 × 9 possible hand position pairs
- **27% expansion**: From 64 to 81 position combinations
- **Complexity scaling**: Significant increase in possibilities

## 📊 Combination Mathematics

### **Expansion Factor**

- **1.33x position expansion**: From 64 to 81 position combinations
- **Dual paradigm complexity**: Different orientation calculations
- **Total combinations**: ~2,240 combinations (1.33x increase from Level 4)
- **Paradigm switching**: Additional complexity from dual systems

### **Mathematical Properties**

- **Coordinate system paradigm shift**: Relative + absolute orientation systems
- **Paradigm switching logic**: Different rules for center vs perimeter
- **Absolute orientation mathematics**: Compass direction calculations
- **Enhanced position space**: 9-position system instead of 8

## 📝 Examples

### **Valid Level 5 Combinations**

```
Center Position Usage:
- Blue: CENTER (STATIC, facing-N), Red: N (PRO, IN)
- Blue: N→CENTER (half-dash, #), Red: S→W (PRO, OUT)
- Blue: CENTER→E (half-dash, #), Red: CENTER (STATIC, facing-S)

Dual Paradigm Examples:
- Blue at N (relative: IN), Red at CENTER (absolute: facing-E)
- Blue at CENTER (absolute: facing-NW), Red at SE (relative: OUT)

Half-Dash Motion:
- Blue: N→CENTER (#, orientation determined by lookup table)

```

### **Orientation Paradigm Examples**

```
Relative Orientations (Perimeter):
- At N: IN (toward center), OUT (away from center)
- At E: CLOCK (perpendicular clockwise), COUNTER (perpendicular counter-clockwise)

Absolute Orientations (Center):
- At CENTER: facing-N, facing-NE, facing-E, facing-SE, facing-S, facing-SW, facing-W, facing-NW
